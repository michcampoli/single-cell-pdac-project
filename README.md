# single_cell_pdac_project
Used unsupervised machine learning methods (Phenograph, InferCNV, UMAP) to detect tumor clones of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells in a single-cell RNA-Seq dataset, then built a supervised machine learning (SVM with stochastic gradient descent) algorithm to identify clones on unseen data.
